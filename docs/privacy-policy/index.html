            <p>Thank you for using <strong>Salesforce Debug Lens</strong>, a Chrome extension designed to help Salesforce developers debug Apex code more efficiently by understanding and visualizing Salesforce debug logs.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p><strong>Salesforce Debug Lens</strong> does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers or third parties. All data is used locally within the extension for its intended functionality.</p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Organization Information:</strong> Retrieves org name and type (Production or Sandbox) for identification and context.</li>
                <li><strong>User Information:</strong> Fetches display name and ID of the logged-in user from Salesforce.</li>
                <li><strong>Debug Logs:</strong> Fetched on demand to analyze and visualize code execution, errors, and flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Apex Classes and Triggers:</strong> Metadata is retrieved based on log insights for relevant execution flow.</li>
                <li><strong>Trace Flags & Debug Levels:</strong> Manage log generation via Salesforce Tooling APIs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p>All data accessed by <strong>Salesforce Debug Lens</strong> is processed and used <strong>only within your local browser environment</strong>. No data is sent to any external servers. The data is used exclusively to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Display organization and user context.</li>
                <li>Parse and visualize debug logs for Apex code analysis.</li>
                <li>Manage Salesforce trace flags and debug levels.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Storage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Minimal org data (e.g., org name and type) is stored locally to improve user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>No External Storage:</strong> No data is stored in any cloud service or remote database.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
                This extension is a full client-side extension that may use your personal browser storage mechanisms but it’s not sending out your data in any way and/or form to other parties except the Salesforce instance you are directly connected and logged in and for the purpose, you are doing with that Salesforce instance and this extension.
            </p>
            <p>You can clear the local data at any time via your browser’s settings.</p>
